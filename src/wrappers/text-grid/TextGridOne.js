              <h2>Our Story From Scratch</h2>
              <p>
                Founded in _______, we are committed to digitally shaping the
                local Indian apparel market! 
              </p>
              <p>
                We believe that the local Indian retail markets for apparel and
                garments possess the potential to grow and deliver a polished
                quality of clothes to Indian households. However, in comparison
                to juggernauts of the fashion industry and leading clothes
                brands, these shops seem to be a bit all over the place and
                unorganized. In the face of growing competition from leading
                vendors, the efforts of the local traditional apparel shops are
                falling flat. The primary issue lies in poor promotion,
                advertising, and store operations management. 
              </p>
              <p>
                We think this can be changed only through some disruption in the
                system! Buynaa steps in as a group of young people from the
                “City of Joy – Kolkata” to alter the condition of the local
                Indian apparel stores. We aim to make an impact by
                revolutionizing the customer’s shopping experience by
                highlighting these mismanaged stores to make them attain what
                they deserve.
